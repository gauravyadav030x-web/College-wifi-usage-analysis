# 📶 College Wi-Fi Usage Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes college Wi-Fi usage data using Python. It focuses on understanding daily data consumption, detecting peak usage days, generating statistical summaries, and visualizing usage trends using line plots.

The project is designed as part of a Minor-1 assignment to demonstrate practical usage of the Pandas library for data analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze daily Wi-Fi data usage
- Generate statistical summaries (mean, max, min, etc.)
- Detect peak Wi-Fi usage day
- Visualize usage trends using a line graph

---

## 🧠 Basic Theory
Wi-Fi usage analysis helps in monitoring network load and identifying high-traffic periods.  
Using **Pandas**, structured data can be efficiently analyzed, while **Matplotlib** helps in visualizing trends for better understanding and decision-making.
